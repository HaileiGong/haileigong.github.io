I am a researcher at ByteDance, Seed. I got my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (THU), advised by Prof. Zhang Zhihai in 2023. I got a B.E. degree at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU) in 2018.

My research interest lies in foundation models for digital humans and AI agents.. Recently, I am super interested in agent tool use and atonomy RL. Discussions and cooperations are welcomed! (Wechat: hulksea)
