I am a researcher at ByteDance, Seed. I got my Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (THU), advised by Prof. Zhang Zhihai in 2023. I got a B.E. degree at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU) in 2018.

My research interests include language models, agentic RL, memory system and etc. Recently, I am super interested in agent atonomy RL and test-time efficiency. Discussions and cooperations are welcomed! (Wechat: hulksea)
